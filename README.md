# pet-health-pal
An Android app for keeping track of the various tasks involved in taking care of pets and keeping track of their health. It uses the Pet Finder API to get data about types of pets.

Authors: Laura Stewart, Sohaib Hussain.

We worked collaboratively on the app, but I focused a bit more on UI while he worked on connecting to the API.
